Code and notes for assignments in Discrete Optimization by Pascal Van Hentenryck (Coursera, Jun 2013).

* requirements

If running .py files, python 2 is required.

If running .pl files, a prolog system with constraint logic programming
modules are required. (Tested on eclipse-clp v6.1 #204).

* running

: make knapsack in_name=ks_4_0
: make coloring in_name=gc_4_1
where =in_name= is one of the files found in =data/knapsack/in= or
=data/coloring/in= respectively.

To check the feasibility of the output, replace each target with
=knapsack_check= or =sat_coloring=
